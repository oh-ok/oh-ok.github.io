Broadway has been labeled as one of the best cinema theatres in the world, it has a theatre designed by the legendary Paul Smith, it was one of the first to premiere Quentin Tarantino's *Pulp Fiction* (as well as others), and it's just an all around great attraction to Nottingham. To reflect Broadway's personality as a distinguished and historically important cinema, I created an indent as part of a live brief set by [The One Off](https://www.theoneoff.com/) to celebrate it's importance in storytelling history. Please see my presentation boards below.
