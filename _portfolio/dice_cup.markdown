The Dice Cup is Nottingham's go-to board game café, featuring hundreds of games in their library, and the option to bring your own along!

I wasn't a huge fan of how their logo and website made them feel like an "underfunded community project". And while they do continute to exist almost solely out off of community spirit during lockdown, I would rather it feel like a nice place to drink coffee and throw some dice around with friends now that we're exiting it (hopefully). Hence, the main focus of my rebrand and redesign was putting the games and the experience at the forefront in a contemporary and unique way. 

This is a board game café, and as such the user experience is based around tabletop gaming tropes, character sheets, decks of cards, randomisation, shaking of dice, etc.
