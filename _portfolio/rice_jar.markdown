The idea for this project was that rice is most often sold in a single use plastic bag, which is not very environmentally friendly when you consider rice consists of 2/5 of the global population's food. I propose a glass and metal jar instead, so that the packaging is useful after consumption, and can be used at zero waste shops. Something similar to what already exists for sauces, but with a twist.

Rice is also notoriously difficult to measure by eye, so I thought it would be nice if the packaging included some kind of portioning system.
