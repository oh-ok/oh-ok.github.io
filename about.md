**Hi, I'm Kieran!**

I'm a designer from East London interested in lots of things! I've always loved playing around with the technical side of design since I first managed to get my hands on After Effects CS4 on my dad's PC. I would watch Video Copilot tutorials every day after school and remake fun movie effects, in awe of the possibilities. I also remember loving to play with Photoshop & Illustrator when I got to college and got to study graphic design properly and hone my skills, learning that this is exactly what I wanted to do. 

It's been a while since then though, I've been to Nottingham Trent University studying Graphic Design and graduating with my degree in 2021, shortly after winning a Portfolio Pick for Graphic Design at D&AD's New Blood Festival. I'm currently looking for my first position in the creative industry.
